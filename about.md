# About me

I am a thirty-something midwesterner born, raised, and living in
Columbus, Ohio.

Things I do in my free time other than tinker with this website include
trying to stay healthy enough to run, taking my dog on walks since she 
doesn't want to run with me, reading tons of books, and trying to 
re-learn how to play piano (I think I'm once again about as proficient as when
I quit as a middle schooler?). 

I work as a data scientist and once got a PhD in math from The Ohio
State University in analytic number theory. As a graduate student
I was lucky to have the opportunity to spend a semester in
Bordeaux, France, which encouraged me to keep learning French
after taking a required language course earlier in my graduate studies.
As an undergraduate, I spent a semester in
Madrid, but that didn't end up being as fruitful as my time in 
France for a variety of reasons, but mostly because I was so 
much younger.

This whole website is an about me, so this is probably enough on this page.
