    "# The Command Line Interpreter (CLI)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lecture is to demystify the command line a bit by giving examples of\n",
    "how to use and talk about why one might use the command line interface (CLI) instead\n",
    "of a more common GUI approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminals\n",
    "\n",
    "The terminal -- technically a _terminal emulator_ ([details](http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/))-- is the program that allows you to\n",
    "interact more directly with a computers file system and programs. Mac OS has its\n",
    "default terminal, the ubuntu flavor of linux has the Gnome Terminal, and Windows has\n",
    "the Powershell. You are not locked into the default terminal, there are many you can\n",
    "use with a search of `best terminals ubuntu 2021` or similar in your preferred search engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux and Mac OS are both Unix-like systems, and share many similarities, and this is\n",
    "what I'll be focusing on. Most of the commands I'll be talking about will be common to\n",
    "both, while Powershell is significantly different. However, since Windows 10, there is a\n",
    "linux subsystem that you can enable on Windows that is, to my knowledge, a stirpped down\n",
    "version of ubuntu. You can enable this and explore the file system on your windows machine.\n",
    "Doing anything with graphics might take some extra work, but can be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [2020 Stack Overflow Developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#development-environments-and-toolss) about 54% of developers use Mac OS or a Linux\n",
    "system, so Windows is by no means dead, but it is slightly less common.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic commands\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where are we?\n",
    "\n",
    "If I open up the terminal, the first thing to do is orient ourselves. You'll be\n",
    "dropped into your home directory. To print your working directory (your location \n",
    "in the file system) you use the `pwd` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "To list the files in this directory you can use `ls`. To see more information about\n",
    "when files were created and how large they are, you might use `ls -lh`, where\n",
    "the dash allows us to add options to the original command. For most commands you\n",
    "can learn more about the options by appending the `--help` option, or read the\n",
    "manual page by typing `man CMD`. To see hidden files and directories (those that start with `.`)\n",
    "you need to use the `-a` flag. You can also look just for files that end with an extension\n",
    "for example by using the _wildcard_ `*`. For example, `ls ./*.py` will only list files\n",
    "that end with `.py` that live in the current directory. The single dot `.` here in\n",
    "`./` refers to the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "To _print working directory_ we used the `pwd` command, what about if we want\n",
    "to _change directory_? Then we use `cd PATH_TO_DIRECTORY`. For example, I'll\n",
    "write `cd Code` to change to the directory named `Code` that is under the\n",
    "current working directory. If you get lost, you can go home again with `cd` and nothing trailing it.\n",
    "To go up from the current directory, you can use `cd ..` or to go up to directories\n",
    "`cd ../..`. To go to the _root_ direcotry of `/` you can type `cd /`. This also allows\n",
    "you to type universal paths not just relative to your current directory. So instead of\n",
    "`cd Code`, if you are somewhere else in the file systems, you could write `cd /home/username/Code`.\n",
    "Another trick is that the tilde means relative to your home directory `cd ~/Code` would\n",
    "also work. You should also be table to hit TAB to autocomplete and search.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to the first benefit of using the command line, it can be MUCH FASTER\n",
    "to navigate the file tree using `cd` just because typing is faster than moving a mouse\n",
    "and clicking. It does not take long to learn where most things you need to use are in the\n",
    "file system, so navigation is quick no matter where you are.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What can I do with these files?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a unix-like system, _everthing is a file_ (roughly), even directories. So it's important\n",
    "to be able to see things about them. While this is a deep statement about the design philosphy of unix-like\n",
    "systems that I won't (can't?) unpack, let's start examining these files. \n",
    "Basic stats can be provided by `ls -lh` as we saw above. \n",
    "\n",
    "To see how many lines a file contains, we can use `wc -l` (word count, with the `-l` flag). To see\n",
    "the first five lines of a file we can use `head -n 5` and to see the ending five lines of a file you can \n",
    "use `tail -n 5`. (Advanced note: if an application is writing to a log file, you can use `tail`\n",
    "to see the log change in real time as the application writes out to it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the entire file, you can use `cat` (derived from concatenate). By default, `cat` prints\n",
    "to standard out (the terminal we are looking at), but we can redirect to a new file\n",
    "with `cat FILE > new.txt` or append to an existing file with `cat FILE >> new.txt`. You can of\n",
    "course copy a file via `cp FILE new.txt` as well. Or move it entirely with `mv FILE new.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we get rid of that new file? `rm new.txt`. Will remove it. To remove a directory,\n",
    "you can `rm -r DIRECTORY` or you might have the command `rmdir DIRECTORY` which will probably\n",
    "complain if the directory is not empty. CAUTION: deletes are permanent unless your files\n",
    "are backed up somewhere, like, say you are in a git directory and you can `git checkout FILE`.\n",
    "Sometimes the system will complain about deleting certain files, asking for \n",
    "explicit permission to do so. In particular, this happens\n",
    "if you try to `rm -r GITHUB_REPO` for some directory that is a github repo. To force delete,\n",
    "you would use the `-f` flag, so you might `rm -rf GITHUB_REPO`. BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN DOING THIS.\n",
    "For example, what is the difference between the following commands? `rm -rf ./*` and `rm -rf /*`?\n",
    "The first deletes everything under the current directory. The second tries to delete everything\n",
    "under the root directory. I have made this mistake ... luckily it was on a VM and not my\n",
    "actual machine, but unluckily most of two weeks of work was not backed up in github...\n",
    "Always double check your `rm` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a directory, you can use the `mkdir` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "To search in a file, you can use the `grep` command to match _regular expressions_, which are\n",
    "patterns. We'll just use a simple `grep` for a word in the current directory. It will print out\n",
    "every line of every file that contains the desired string of characters (even if its just part of\n",
    "a word). To search every file in a directory, we can use `grep WORD ./*` where we have used\n",
    "the wildcard `*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common use case is not to use grep on a file, but to _pipe_ the output of another \n",
    "programming into grep to parse just the relevant information. For example, to see\n",
    "which python packages are installed in our current environment we can use `pip freeze`.\n",
    "But there's a lot! Suppose we just care about the version of `pandas`. Then we can\n",
    "write `pip freeze | grep pandas`. The `|` is the pipe which connects the two commands. \n",
    "You should take a moment to appreciate how powerful this chaining of commands without\n",
    "intervening variables can be. Is it immediately apparent how to pipe seemingly unrelated\n",
    "commands together in python, for example?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Who are we and what are we allowed to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "To see who are you connected as, you can use the `users` command. To see what machine you \n",
    "are on, you can use `hostname`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier when we ran `ls -lh` we could see that my name was repeated twice in front of\n",
    "the file sizes. This referred to the owner of the file and the group owner of the file.\n",
    "To see what groups you belong to. You can see that I, `kevin` belong to the `kevin` group\n",
    "among many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beginning of that command tells us what that file can be used to do. I won't go\n",
    "over the structure of that string other than to say that `r` is read, `w` is write, \n",
    "and `x` is execute. Where these are present tells you whether the permissions are\n",
    "at the owner, group, or global levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The commands to change the owner of a file is `chown` and the command to modify\n",
    "permissions is `chmod`. You might write a python script that you want to execute\n",
    "directly and you'll need to add the\n",
    "execute permission to it with `chmod +x script.py` so that you can run it \n",
    "by simply running `script.py` instead of `python script.py`. Permissions such as this\n",
    "can be tracked by git.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most powerful user on a unix-like machine is the _root_ user. This user has permissions\n",
    "to edit permissions and thus edit and execute any file on the system (roughly). You \n",
    "probably do not have root-level permissions natively, but since you are on your\n",
    "personal machine, you can run probably run commands as if you were the root user (roughly). \n",
    "To do this...\n",
    "you prepend `sudo` to any command. This stands for \"superuser do\". You can also use `sudo -s`\n",
    "to become the root user in a shell.\n",
    "For example, if I don't have permission to view\n",
    "a directory called `/some/protected/directory` I could still change into this directory\n",
    "by running `sudo -s` and then running `cd /some/protected/directory`. Depending on your settings, you\n",
    "might be prompted for your password. Note that when I ran the `groups` command, \n",
    "I was part of the `sudo` group, a/k/a I am a _sudoer_. \n",
    "\n",
    "RUNNING SUDO COMMANDS IS DANGEROUS!! You can easily, say, delete the majority of your\n",
    "file system if you run something dumb. Try to avoid `sudo` as much as you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Can I leave my computer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Potentially. One thing that is useful about using the terminal, is that it is very\n",
    "low level and present on every machine. You might have access to a virtual machine\n",
    "somewhere else. You might be able to connect with a graphical interface, but its\n",
    "very commont to `ssh` into the machine. For example, I have a virtual machine setup\n",
    "in Microsoft azure and I can connect with it via `ssh kevin@<ip address>` and\n",
    "I can interact with it via its terminal to which I have connected. I don't have\n",
    "a graphical connection, this is how I interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hello, world?\n",
    "\n",
    "We never did the hello world thing, so to print to standard out, you can `echo Hello, world!`.\n",
    "A thing you might do is `echo *.pyc >> .gitignore` to append this line into your\n",
    "`.gitignore` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment that you are in is controlled by environment variables. You can print\n",
    "the current environment variables by running `printenv` It spits out a lot, so you might \n",
    "want to restrict what you see by piping to `grep` as we did above.\n",
    "To set an environment variable, you can use `export VAR=value`. Note that the variables\n",
    "are uppercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run `top` to get some stats about what is happening on your machine. Hitting `m` while\n",
    "`top` is running will switch from CPU to memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are these commands?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interacting with the terminal using a command line interpreter called `bash`. \n",
    "This stands for \"Born Again Shell\" which is based on the language `sh` which\n",
    "is another shell (it is clear what it stands for...). You can enter into `sh`\n",
    "by typing it into your terminal and still run many commands. One command you might\n",
    "find useful if you have just done this is `exit` which will return you from whence\n",
    "you came back into a `bash` based prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the design philosophies behind these tools is that none of these base\n",
    "commands should be complicated, and they should work well. Anything that\n",
    "requires complex manipulation, for a very conservative definition of \"complex\", \n",
    "should be done in a script and designed as needed. Do you need to move a file and\n",
    "change its permissions based on the permissions of the directory you are moving it\n",
    "into? That's two commands, not just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other options, `fish` is actually what I mostly use. It's not common because\n",
    "it is not POSIX compatible -- i.e., it does not conform to the most common standard\n",
    "for shells. The second most common POSIX compatible shell is `zsh`, which you might\n",
    "want to explore. I would recommend sticking with `bash` or `zsh` or another\n",
    "POSIX compatible shell until you are comfortable, as almost all unix-like \n",
    "systems will have `bash` installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### But can I make it pretty?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many programs have config files such as ssh, and mostly these are hidden files in your home directory.\n",
    "In linux systems you can edit the `.bashrc` file to change how the bash program sets itself\n",
    "up and presents itself. On Mac OS you might need to edit `.bash_profile` instead.\n",
    "Note that I have different colors for my name and the file\n",
    "directory -- These visual cues are important when you are switching between profiles and\n",
    "ssh'ing into other computers. I also have it displaying which conda env is\n",
    "active and information about the state of the current git repository if I'm in one.\n",
    "A common thing to do is set various environment variables using the `export` command."

    "\n",
    "Okay, but we haven't acutally edited any files other than deleting them or creating directories. How do I \n",

    "\n",

    "And now we enter into holy war territory... what is the best text editor to use from the command line to\n",
    "edit a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the inoffensive option that no one uses: `nano`. This is an editor that most unix-like\n",
    "operating systems will come with. It is extremely lightweight, but you can write to a file,\n",
    "do some simple searching, and save the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two options for which you'll find many partisans are vi (actually vim, these days) and emacs.\n",
    "I use vim, mostly because I got confused by emacs when I first started programming and refused to\n",
    "use a command line text editor. When I came around, my bad experience led me to use vim. Is vim\n",
    "any easier or better? I honestly don't know. But I do know that vim, or at least vi, is part of the\n",
    "POSIX standard while emacs is not, so vim is present on pretty much every unix-like machine you\n",
    "might find yourself on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a file using vim, you just use `vi file.txt`. Typically `vi` and `vim` point to the same\n",
    "place. To see this, you can run `which vi` and `which vim` to see where they point then\n",
    "run `ls -lh` on the files you see as the result of those commands to see where these files \n",
    "actually point. Do this repeatedly, and you'll usually see that you end up calling the same\n",
    "executable for both commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "vi is a mode-based editor. So at first you can just move around with the arrow keys. To start\n",
    "editing inline, hit `i` and start typing away. Hit escape to go back to normal mode. To \n",
    "save the file hit `:w` and to exit hit `:q`. These commands can be combined as `:x`.\n",
    "There are commands to search and replace, e.g., `:% s/word/new word/g`, which looks very\n",
    "complicated but you can get the hang of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "My recommendation is to get familiar with vi. It's somewhat unnatural at first, but you'll find\n",
    "that, as with the command line, it can become much faster than a GUI based editor. If you\n",
    "find yourself having to connect to virtual machines, you'll always have it at your fingertips.\n",
    "It's also lightweight, has a homegrown packaging system, and the ability to perform\n",
    "syntax highlighting, linting, and can edit many files at once without crashing. Emacs is also a\n",
    "fine choice and there's a good chance its pre-installed on whatever machine you are working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, modern integrated development environments can probably offer you much more out \n",
