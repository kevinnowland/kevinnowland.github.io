    "\n",
    "In this post I'm going to explore how to implement [AlphaZero](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01815.pdf)\n",
    "to learn how to play Brandub (a tafl variant). I previously put together a [Brandub package](https://github.com/kevinnowland/brandub)\n",
    "which I won't use directly, but whose code I will modify as needed. You can find the rules of the\n",
    "game there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this is to prove that I understand the algorithm well enough to implement\n",
    "a very crude version of it. How crude? I doubt the best trained player after even a few days of training\n",
    "will be able to play very well. My big question is whether the trained model can beat me, who has\n",
    "never played a full game before despite all this coding that I've done.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game play technology\n",
    "\n",
    "AlphaZero plays games using two main pieces of technology. The first is a neural network $f\\_\\theta(s)$ with\n",
    "parameters $\\theta$ which takes the current game state $s$ and outputs $(p, z)$ where where $p$ is a probability\n",
    "vector of all possible moves and $z \\in [-1, 1]$ is an estimated game score for the current player with -1 being a\n",
    "loss, 0 a draw, and 1 a win. Only the neural network parameters $\\theta$ will be learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "One could play \n",
    "just using $f\\_\\theta$ by choosing moves according to the output move probabilities $p$, \n",
    "but instead of doing this, we rely on\n",
    "the second piece of technology, a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. The tree search\n",
    "uses the neural network to explore the space of moves and choose the best one taking into account\n",
    "how the game might proceed. The neural network output, as we will\n",
    "see later, is extremely raw and can suggest moves which are illegal (moving an opponent's piece) or \n",
    "even impossible (moving off the board). In addition to suggestiongm oves which will likely lead to victory\n",
    "for the curernt player, the tree search algorithm helps encode the rules of the game\n",
    "by by only exploring using legal moves. The tree\n",
    "search is not learned directly, but does take as inputs the neural network $f\\_\\theta$ and current game state. \n",
    "The output is a policy $\\pi$, a probability vector that is used to select the next move.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Give the neural network and MCTS algorithm, play proceeds until a game ends at step $T$.\n",
    "At each step $t$ of the game we have neural network output $(p\\_t, v\\_t)$ as well as \n",
    "the policy $\\pi\\_t$ governing move selection. The final game result is $s\\_T \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. \n",
    "The loss $\\ell\\_t$ for a step is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\ell\\_t = (v\\_t - s\\_T)^2 - \\pi\\_t^t\\log p\\_t + c \\|\\theta\\|^2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $c$ is an $\\ell^2$-regularization parameter. Thus we are looking at mean squared\n",
    "error for the \n",
    "predicted output $v$ with cross-entropy forcing predicted moved probabilities $p$ to look like \n",
    "the MCTS policy $\\pi$ with a regularization term.\n",
    "The overall loss function is the average of this over the $T$ moves making up the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each game, we backpropagate from the loss function through the nerual network to\n",
    "change the neural network parameters $\\theta$. Note that while policies $\\pi\\_t$ do depend on \n",
    "$\\theta$ since the MCTS takes the nerual network as input, we will pretend it does not and thus \n",
    "does not affect backpropogation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game State\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of a game is encoded similarly but not identically to what was done in the brandub\n",
    "package. The state tensor has is a stack of 7x7 binary tensors and some constant tensors.\n",
    "The first layer encodes the current player's pawns and the second layer is the current player's\n",
    "monarch. The current player might be the attacker and not have a monarch, but that is fine and\n",
    "the input plane will be all zero. These layers repeat with the opponent's positions. \n",
    "AlphaZero maintains 8 timesteps of history, but we will try to keep only 3, if that. While the connections\n",
    "from these planes into the neural net\n",
    "will be learned and truly will be input, I suspect their main use will be checking to see if a \n",
    "position has repeated leading to a draw. AlphaZero for Chess contains two more constant planes, \n",
    "either 1 or 0, depending on if the current position has repeated once or twice before.\n",
    "Probably the order matters, although I am not sure. Since brandub ends in a draw with only a \n",
    "single repeated position, we do not need to encode this information for the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition we will include a constant plane that is not repeated to indicate which player is\n",
    "playing, either 0 for defense or 1 for attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this leads to a game state tensor of size $7\\times7\\times(4\\times3 + 1)$, i.e.,\n",
    "we have 637 features."

    "Finally, we can implement some learning! We'll use Adam as the optimizer. Initially I was\n",

    "much improvement. This could also have been related to the fact that we were only giving it\n",
    "25 MCTS iterations. Upon further inspection, this meant that the model was only looking at most\n",
    "two moves ahead, which makes sense given that the branching factor (before symmetry) is probably\n",

    "\n",
    "After playing around some, I upped the MCTS iterations to 300 and decided to train in epochs.\n",

    "per epoch. There's no great reason behind this, I just did not want to throw away the training\n",
    "I had done. The first epoch was trained as you see below. If you look at commit 66faa4 you'll see\n",
    "the notebook that forms this post with multiprocessing for the second epoch. From the printouts\n",
    "you'll notice that each game is taking almost a quarter of an hour with two processes. This is\n",
    "3x slower than the first epoch took per game! The overhead is apparently not worth it. I had \n",
    "decided on two processes because my laptop has 12 cores and one game was taking up 6 of them.\n",
    "Apparently the multiprocessing overhead is very serious however. Perhaps I am sharing objects\n",
    "in a way that is not desirable, given that I'm no expert with that. Also it did not work! The\n",
    "code hung when trying to get the loss determined by each process from the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, I'm back to using one process and doing 125 games per epoch. This was chosen \n",
    "because the output leads to believe that with ~100 games the average loss and\n",
    "average timing are decently stable and 125 is half of the 250 I started with originally."
