description: Implementation of the brandub variant of tafl
---

UPDATE: I decided to package this up and upload it to pypi. You can install
it on your own machine via
```bash
pip install brandub
```
and play it yourself (against yourself unless you're on some video call that allows
you screen share...) via the `brandub` command in your favorite terminal.

I'm going to implement the brandub / brandubh / brannumh variant of the viking game 
of tafl / hnefatafl. Eventually I want to do some 
reinforcement learning with this. The fundamental point of the game is that
there is a monarch in a castle that wishes to escape to the forest. The monarch
has a set of defenders to escort them and a set of attackers trying to prevent them
from reaching the forest. In this. particular case, the board is 7x7 with four
defenders and eight attackers. The rules that I'm going by can be found
[here](http://tafl.cyningstan.com/page/171/brandub).

I'm going to kick this off with some errors. This is clearly ahistorical to how 
this was developed, but this is where they ended up. Sorry!

```python
import numpy as np
from IPython.display import clear_output
```

```python
class UnsettableAttributeError(Exception):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("can't set attribute explicitly once set")
        
        
class InvalidTeamNameError(Exception):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("team name must be 'attack' or 'defense'")
        
        
class InvalidMoveError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, msg):
        super().__init__(msg)
```

My initial attempt at this (not present here, maybe in an early commit?) was object
oriented, but it was proving to be a nightmare and hard to divide up responsibilites. 
Instead I'm going to implement a more purefly functional approach. I think this will 
also be helpful in using reinforcement learning because it will be much easier to advance 
the board state and explore trees of possible lines of play. I will create a slew of custom
classes now, but they will be non-mutable and should be easier to instantiate.

There are only three types of pieces, attacking pawns, defending pawns, and the defense's
monarch. The board is 7x7 -- although it is effectively smaller for some pieces -- so that
means the board state should be represented as a 3x7x7 array. We'll start by adding
just a little bit of funcationality to the numpy arrays in a `RawBoard` class.

I also tried implementing this with `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix` instances instead of
`numpy` arrays, but the extra methods necessary for sparse arrays actually make it
so that the `numpy` arrays use about 20% less memory. They are more convenient to
use anyway.

To endow the raw board with some more functionality that's brandub specific.
We'll check things like making sure that only one piece is on a tile and
that there aren't too many pieces for each player. We'll add a `shadow_pretty` that
is visually interpretable and allow for checking victory for each team. Note
that eqiuivalence is determined by falling back to the equality of matrices we
rely on to determine equivalance of `RawBoard` instances.

I hope it's reasonable to create a method that returns a `Board` with pieces
set up for the opening of brandub.

```python
def get_initial_board(fully_validate_board=True):
    
    indices = [
        (0, 3, 0),
        (0, 3, 1),
        (0, 3, 5),
        (0, 3, 6),
        (0, 0, 3),
        (0, 1, 3),
        (0, 5, 3),
        (0, 6, 3),
        (1, 3, 2),
        (1, 3, 4),
        (1, 2, 3),
        (1, 4, 3),
        (2, 3, 3)
    ]
    
    x = np.zeros((3, 7, 7))
    for i in indices:
        x[i] = 1
    
    raw_board = RawBoard(board_array=x,
                         skip_checks=not fully_validate_board)
    
    return Board(raw_board, fully_validate_board)
```

Let's show that this works. The `Board.__str__` method prings out the board with 
empty tiles having zero with pieces represented by the following point values:
- -1 = attacking pawn
- 1 = defending pawn
- 2 = the monarch

```python
board = get_initial_board()
print(board)
```

    [[ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [-1. -1.  1.  2.  1. -1. -1.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]]


Now let's determine valid moves for a piece. As a reminder, all pieces move
horizontally or vertically any number of spaces. Pieces cannot jump over
other pieces, but they can jump past the castle. No piece may land on the
empty (or occupied) castle, and only the monarch may land in a forest.

```python
def is_forest(position_2d):
    """ returns whether the first two coords of
    position_2d is a forest"""
    return position_2d[0] in [0, 6] and position_2d[1] in [0, 6]

def is_castle(position_2d):
    """ returns whether the first two coords of position_2d
    is a castle"""
    return position_2d[0] == 3 and position_2d[1] == 3

def find_valid_moves(board, position):
    """ find valid moves for the piece at the given position.
    this assumes there is a piece at the position.
    
    position must be tuple (i, j, k)"""
    is_pawn = position[0] < 2
    
    shadow = board.shadow
    pos_2d = np.array(position[1:])
    
    def check_direction(direction_vector):
        """ get valid moves in the given direction

        valid_moves = []
        
        coord = 0 if direction_vector[0] != 0 else 1
        positive_direction = direction_vector[coord] == 1
        end_value = 6 if positive_direction else 0
        
        keep_going = pos_2d[coord] != end_value
        i = 0
        while keep_going:
            i += 1
            
            new_pos = pos_2d + i * direction_vector
            
            # stop if run into a piece
            if shadow[tuple(new_pos)] == 1:
                break
                
            # ignore the castle
            if is_castle(new_pos):
                continue
                
            keep_going = new_pos[coord] != end_value
            
            # if pawn and at the wall, see if its a forest but don't add
            if not keep_going and is_pawn and is_forest(new_pos):
                break
                
            valid_moves.append(tuple(new_pos))
            
        return valid_moves

    direction_vectors = (
        np.array([1, 0]),
        np.array([-1, 0]),
        np.array([0, 1]),
        np.array([0, -1])
    )
    
    return [
        (position[0], vec[0], vec[1])
        for dvec in direction_vectors
        for vec in check_direction(dvec)
    ]
```

The other main piece of gameplay is determine whether a piece is captured.
Pawns are captured if they are trapped either horizontally or vertically
by any combination of enemy pawns, forests, or empty castles. The attacking
pawns also have to watch out for the occupied castle since only the
defense's monarch can occupy it, while the defense's pawns only have to worry
about the empty castle (is it haunted?). If the monarch is ensconced in the castle,
then they only have to worry if surrounded on all four sides by enemy pawns.
If they are next to the vacant castle (horzonally or vertically) then they only 
have to worry only if surrounded on all three sides by enemy pawns. Otherwise, the
monarch can be captured as if they were a pawn.

    ]
    
    return RawBoard(indices=remaining_positions,
                    skip_checks=raw_board.skip_checks)
```

With all of that implemented we can create a `move` method to iterate the positions on the board with
a given move. Of course, I started out implementing this method when I had only developed `RawBoard` and
`Board`, but then I changed it to be compatible with `GameState` and `GameHistory`.
Those changes are almost cosmetic though, as they call down to the underlying board
before applying the movement logic.

```python
def move(piece_position, new_position, board=None,
         game_state=None, game_history=None):
    """
    create a new board by moving the piece at
    piece_position to new_position and clearing
    off any captured pieces.
    
    piece_position and new_position should
    be (i, j, k) tuples.
    """

    # remove pieces
    clean_raw_board = remove_captured_pieces(new_raw_board)
    new_board = Board(clean_raw_board, board.fully_validate_board)
    
    if game_state is None and game_history is None:
        return new_board
    elif game_state is not None:

            new_game_states = game_history.game_states[1:] + [new_game_state]
        else:
            new_game_states = game_history.game_states + [new_game_state]
        
        return GameHistory(new_game_states, game_history.max_length)
        
```

And now let's run some examples form the initial state.

```python
board = get_initial_board()
print(board)
```

    [[ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [-1. -1.  1.  2.  1. -1. -1.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]]


```python
board = move((0, 3, 0), (0, 2, 0), board)
print(board)
```

    [[ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [-1.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0. -1.  1.  2.  1. -1. -1.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]]


```python
board = move((1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 1), board)
print(board)
```

    [[ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [-1.  1.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0. -1.  1.  2.  1. -1. -1.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]]


```python
board = move((0, 2, 0), (0, 1, 0), board)
print(board)
```

    [[ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [-1.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  1.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0. -1.  1.  2.  1. -1. -1.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]]


```python
board = move((1, 2, 1), (1, 1, 1), board)
print(board)
```

    [[ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [-1.  1.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0. -1.  1.  2.  1. -1. -1.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]]


And now the attackers can capture the defending pawn at (1, 1):

```python
board = move((0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 2), board)
print(board)
```

    [[ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [-1.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0. -1.  1.  2.  1. -1. -1.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]]


But they haven't won yet!

```python
board.check_victory('attack')
```




    False



Now we add some more funcionality to the `Board` class in the form of the
`GameState` class. As before, we do not subset `Board`, since it's not
a specific version, it's an enhanced version. However, we probably could
do it that way.

```python
class GameState:
    """ this class enhances the board with some more gameplay aspects.
    also validates the validity of the board slightly. """
    
    def __init__(self, board, whose_turn):
        
        assert type(board) == Board
        self.__board = board
        
        assert not (self.attack_victory and self.defense_victory), \
            "only one of attack and defense can win"
        
        assert whose_turn in ["attack", "defense"], \
            "whose_turn must be 'attack' or 'defense'"
        self.__whose_turn = whose_turn
        
        
    def __eq__(self, other):
        """ equality based on board state """
        return self.board == other.board \
            and self.whose_turn == other.whose_turn
            
    
    
    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.board.shadow_pretty)
        
    
    @property
    def board(self):
        return self.__board
    
    
    @property
    def possible_moves(self):
        if self.whose_turn == "attack":
            pos_index = [0]
        elif self.whose_turn == "defense":
            pos_index = [1, 2]
        else:
            raise InvalidTeamNameError
        
        return [
            (p, pp)
            for p in self.board.positions if p[0] in pos_index
            for pp in find_valid_moves(self.board, p)
        ]
    
    
    @property
    def attack_victory(self):
        return self.__check_victory("attack")
    
    
    @property
    def defense_victory(self):
        return self.__check_victory("defense")
    
    
    @property
    def has_winner(self):
        return self.attack_victory or self.defense_victory
        
    
    @property
    def whose_turn(self):
        return self.__whose_turn
    
    
    def __check_victory(self, team):
        return self.board.check_victory(team)
```

Now we prove that our _post hoc_ editing of `move` was
effective.

```python
game_state = GameState(get_initial_board(), "attack")
print("initial state:")
print(game_state)
game_state = move((0, 3, 0), (0, 2, 0), game_state=game_state)
print("\nafter move:")
print(game_state)
```

    initial state:
    [[ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [-1. -1.  1.  2.  1. -1. -1.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]]
    
    after move:
    [[ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [-1.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0. -1.  1.  2.  1. -1. -1.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0. -1.  0.  0.  0.]]


Brandub can end in draws if a board position is repeated. So we'll implement
a `GameHistory` class to keep track of `GameState` instances to look for ties.
Note that draws are determined at the `Board` level, not the `GameState` level, 
as it's conceivable that the players go in a circle. By default we'll only 
keep track of 5 states.

```python
class GameHistory:
    """ hold n GameState objects and check if the game is over
    via a draw or victory """
    
    def __init__(self, game_states, max_length=5):
        
        assert max_length > 0, "max_length must be positive"
        self.__max_length = max_length
        
        assert type(game_states) == list, "game_states must bve list"
        assert len(game_states) <= self.max_length, \
            "can't have more gamme states than max_length"
        assert len(game_states) > 0, \
            "must have at lesat one initial game state"
        assert all(type(state) == GameState for state in game_states), \
            "all elements of game_states. must be GameState"
        if len(game_states) > 1:
            assert all(not state.has_winner for state in game_states[:-1]), \
                "only final game state can have a winner"
            
        self.__game_states = game_states
        
        
    def __getitem__(self, *args):
        return self.game_states.__getitem__(*args)
    
    
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.game_states)
        
        
    @property
    def current_state(self):
        return self[-1]

    def max_length(self):

    @classmethod
    def __has_draw(cls, game_states):

        assert len(game_states) > 1, "must have at least two games"
        
        has_draw = any(gs.board == game_states[-1].board for gs in game_states[:-1])
        if has_draw:

            return cls.__has_draw(game_states[:-1])
        else:
            return False
```

And now let's run through a draw and victories by each team.

So far we've tried to stay as functional as possible. And I think when I try to teach
an agent to play the game we'll only use the classes above. But I also want to be able
to play a normal game and it makes sense to make a `BrandubGame` class for a whole
game. This class will be mutable (although only via internal methods) and is 
expected to last for a whole game.

```python
class BrandubGame:
    """  object oriented class for playing a whole game """
