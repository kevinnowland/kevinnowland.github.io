## Work

### 2017, 2018 - Present: [CoverMyMeds](https://www.covermymeds.com/main/)

#### Senior Data Scientist (2020-Present); Data Scientist (2018-2020)

- Brought to production multiple models (SQL-based and then python-based)
used to estimate approval likelihood for prior authorizations which
helped drive adoption of company software by a regional pharmacy
chain resulting in increased revenue.
- Architected productionization process for the data science team's 
models via a combination of SQL stored procedures, an adhoc model 
registry based on docker images, building API images from those images,
and exploiting the company's existing CI/CD technology used by software development teams.
- Implemented algorithm in SQL to determine therapeutic alternatives for
prescribed medication by incorporating drug switching observed in 
pharmacies with knowledge from in-house pharmacists and third party
drug equivalence information.
Software using this algorithm was integrated into pharmacies,
electronic health records, and CoverMyMeds' portal.
- Re-wrote SQL stored procedures used to generate data for multiple in
production data science models including the use and implementation of
star schemas.
- Started company's data science journal club.
- Agile SME for data science team.
- Established greater connections between the business unit containing
the data science team and Talent Management to discuss how to improve
diversity in hiring for data centric roles.

#### Intern (Summer 2017)

- Implemented particle swarm and Baysiean optimization algorithms for
hyperparameter tuning in scala.

### 2017, 2020 - Present: [Erdos Institute](https://erdosinstitute.org/)

#### 2020-Present: Head of Alumni Relations

- Started Boot Camp Plus seminar for graduates of the Erdos Institute
Data Science Boot Camp to help build additional skills 
- Organized LinkedIn group to help maintain connections among 
graduate school alumni who participated in Erdos Institute programming
- Met with potential corporate partners
