## Work

### 2018 - Present: CoverMyMeds

#### Data Scientist 

- Brought to production multiple versions of algorithm
used to determine approval likelihood for prior authorizations
which led to on-going pilot program with regional pharmacy chain.
- Implemented algorithm in SQL to determine therapeutic alternatives for
prescribed medications based on drug switching behavior observed in 
pharmacies. Pilot anticipated with pharmacy software system vendor
in summer 2020.
- Architected productionization process for containerized data science 
APIs to run in Azure Kubernetes Service.
- Re-wrote SQL backend for generating data for XGBoost model predicting
whether a prior authorization would be needed before a prescription was
sent to the pharmacy.
- Supervised time series forecasting project which was integrated into
company-wide volume and revenue projections.
- Started company data science journal club.

#### Intern

- Implemented hyperparameter tuning algorithms in scala

### 2014-2017: The Ohio State University

#### Graduate Teaching Assistant

- Led recitation sections for various calculus classes
- Wrote and graded quizzes

#### Research Associate

- Provided statistical analysis of effectiveness of different teaching methods
for introductory calculus courses

### 2010: NASA

#### Undergraduate Summer Research Program

- Determined theoretical mean and variance of fieldwork estimates
- Provided linear estimates of forest cover from LiDAR and shuttle data
