    <p> Are you looking for Kevin Nowland's home page? It's not here yet! </p>

      This is the beginnings for what is going to become my personal website.
      In reality, this will probably function as a professional website,
      in that it's meant to showcase some of my professional skills.
      But who knows, it might not be exclusively that.

    <p> Obligatory: Hello, World! </p>
