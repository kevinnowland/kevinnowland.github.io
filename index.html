    <h2>Career</h2>

    <p>
      I currently work as a Site Reliability Engineer at
      <a href="https://www.mimecast.com">Mimecast</a>. I have previously worked
      as an Machine Learning Operations Engineer at Aware, which was acquired by
      Mimecast.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before that, I was a data scientest at
      <a href="https://www.covermymeds.health">CoverMyMeds</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Much earlier I worked the counter at a pie shop called Just Pies. I didn't
      learn to bake then, but I do enjoy making pies now.
    </p>

    <h2>Education</h2>

    <p>
      I received a PhD in Mathematics from
      <a href="https://math.osu.edu/">The Ohio State University</a> in 2018. The
      title of my thesis was "Properties of SU(2, 1) Hecke-Maas cusp forms and
      Eisenstein series." My advisor was Roman Holowinsky. I also helped out
      toward the beginning of his
      <a href="https://www.erdosinstitute.org/">Erdős institute</a> both as a
      student and after.
    </p>

    <p>
      During my doctorate, I had the opportunity to spend a semester at the
      Université de Bordeaux working with Guillaume Martin. I really enjoyed
      being in France.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also have a master's degree from the Program in Applied and
      Computational Mathematics from Princeton, as well as an undergraduate
      degree in mathematics from Pomona College.
    </p>

    <p>
      During my mathematical studies I became in tune with canonical web design
      from studying math professors' websites. Consider that of Abel Prize
      winner
      <a href="https://michel.talagrand.net/">Michel Talagrand</a>.
