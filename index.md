# Kevin Nowland's Homepage

This is my homepage after reading (1) tutorial about using
Github pages. Truly magnificent. Most of the links at the
top will be dead.

This will be my foray into creating a personal website for
myself. Personal in this case is defined as "semi-professional,
meant to be a way to show some rudimentary coding and data
science skills."

Obligatory: Hello, World!
